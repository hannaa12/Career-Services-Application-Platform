**Preconditions**

Any preconditions that must be met prior to the test being executed.

**Test Steps**

The test steps should include the data and information on how to execute the test.  

This is perhaps the most important part of a test case. 

Keep this section clear and concise (a list would be fine), but don’t leave out any necessary details.

**Expected Result**

The expected result tells the tester what they should experience as a result of the test steps.

This is how the tester determines if the test case is a “pass” or “fail”.
